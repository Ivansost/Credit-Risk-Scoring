# Credit Risk Scoring with Pandas, SQL, and Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project uses the **UCI credit card dataset**, which contains **30,000 customer records**. The dataset includes demographic details (age, sex, education, marital status), financial information (credit limits, bill amounts, repayment history), and whether the customer defaulted on their next payment. 

The purpose of this project was to:  
- Demonstrate **parsing and cleaning large datasets** with pandas and SQL.  
- Use **data visualization** to find trends, such as who is more likely to default, who has higher credit limits, and who spends the most.  
- Apply **machine learning** (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) to predict which customers are likely to default and why.
